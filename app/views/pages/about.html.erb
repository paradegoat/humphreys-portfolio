              Hello, my name's Geoff Humphreys. Iâ€™m a developer currently living in Durham, NC. Ruby on Rails is the language and framework I know best, but I want to learn as much as I can before I shuffle off.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside of work, I keep bees in the backyard, I like to listen to Ennio Morricone while writing code, I have a dog named Merle, and I love to build things. My wife and I would love to see all 58 national parks from the front door of our 1989 Airsteam Excella.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you need any work done, or just want to talk, send me a message!
              <br />
              <br />
