              <!-- Hello, my name is Geoff. Iâ€™m a developer currently living in Durham, NC.  I started programming when I realized that I could make literally anything with code. Ruby on Rails is the language and framework I know best and all I want to do is learn as much as I can before I shuffle off.
              <br />
              I keep bees in the backyard, I love Ennio Morricone, and I have a dog named Merle. My wife and I would love to see all 58 national parks from the front porch of our 1989 Airsteam Excella.
              <br />
              If you need any work done, or just want to talk, send me a message on the contact page! -->
